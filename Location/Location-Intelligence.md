# Local Intelligence
The PRC Muhafiz Volunteers will be sending live data from the field, that will require real time visulization and analysis.

# Objective
Use GIS and Statistical Tools to model disease spread and outcome in locations.

In an epidemic Geographic Information System (GIS) systems can help monitor the extent of disease coverage at regional, district or even sub-district level. It can also provide a graphical analysis of epidemiological indicators over time, the spatial distribution and severity of the disease, identify pockets of high endemicity and indicate where there is a need to target extra resources. 

GIS provide an excellent means of analyzing epidemiological data, revealing trends, dependencies and inter-relationships that would otherwise remain hidden in data shown only in a tabular format. GIS can therefore be seen as a valuable management tool in the elimination programme, strengthening national, regional and sub-regional capacities in surveillance and monitoring.

People in the Local Intelligence team will be requires to develop visualizations and metrics for the prevelance, proximity and severity of the disease based on

1. Symptom Data from the Field
2. Population Data from assorted sources
3. Data from local hospitals and pharmacies
4. Social Media

## Exercise (To motivate thinking about the problem) 
What kinds of geographic questions can you come up with in regards to COVID-19 across Pakistan?

Where? Why? What if?

## Deliverables
1. Visulizations that make sense. [See this for a high level overview](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/mapping/mapping-coronavirus-responsibly/)
2. Metrics for Disease prevalance and severity by locations
